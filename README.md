# CSS-art-gallery
This repository contains the files for creating a front-end for a CSS Art Gallery. It uses pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript to complete the task.

You can create an account/login. While logged in, you can submit your own artwork, view and like other artworks anddelete any artwork you have previously uploaded. While logged out, you can only view the artworks.

### Note:
There is no backend connectivity. All data is stored locally in your browser's local storage. **This is NOT secure.** It has been used here since this is a dummy project created for a college assignment. If you wish to actually use any of this code seriously, consider connecting it to a database. But if you just want to play around, it is fine just as it is. Be careful not to store or upload any sensitive information on it.

### How to use it:
If you wish to use it as-is, simply download all HTML, CSS and .js files (there are 16 of them) into a single folder. Then you can just right-click or double click on an HTML file to run the program in your browser. 

#### Disclaimer:
The CSS design for this website has been created using Google AI Studio's Gemini Flash Thinkin Experimental Model. I do not claim ownership of the CSS code. The web development course this assignment was created for would only asses our Javascript knowledge. Hence, I decided to out-source the CSS.
